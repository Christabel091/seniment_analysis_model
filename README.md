# Sentiment Analysis Model using Classification and Vector Spaces

## Overview

This project implements a sentiment analysis model using classification techniques and vector spaces in Natural Language Processing (NLP). The goal is to analyze and classify the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of text data.

## Features

- **Classification Techniques:** Utilizes machine learning algorithms for sentiment classification.
- **Vector Spaces:** Implements vector space models to represent text data.
- **NLP Techniques:** Leverages Natural Language Processing techniques for text preprocessing and feature extraction.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: (list the libraries you are using, e.g., nltk, scikit-learn, etc.)
- Any specific hardware requirements, if applicable

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/sentiment-analysis.git
