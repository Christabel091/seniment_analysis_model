4. Data Collection and Preprocessing
Download a parallel corpus dataset from sources like OPUS or Masakhane.
Save the dataset in your project directory (e.g., data/swahili-english.csv).
Preprocess the data by:
Loading the dataset into a DataFrame.
Tokenizing the sentences.
Splitting the data into training and test sets.
5. Model Development
Choose your deep learning framework: TensorFlow or PyTorch.
Define the model architecture:
Implement an Encoder-Decoder architecture.
Include an attention mechanism if desired.
Set up the training process:
Define the optimizer and loss function.
Implement the training loop, including backpropagation and gradient descent.
6. Evaluation and Inference
Evaluate the model using appropriate metrics such as BLEU score.
Implement a function to translate new sentences using the trained model.
7. Save and Load the Model
Save the trained model to disk.
Load the model from disk for future use or deployment.
8. Deployment (Optional)
Consider deploying the model using a web framework like Flask or Django to create a translation API.
Set up the deployment environment, ensuring that all dependencies are included.
Deploy the model to a cloud service if needed (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure).
